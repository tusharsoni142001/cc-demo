# Employee Management REST API

This project is a basic Employee Management REST API developed using Java and Spring Boot. It is designed to showcase how to build a simple backend service for storing and managing employee information with modern Java technologies.

## Project Overview

The application exposes several endpoints to manage employee records in a relational database using RESTful principles. It is intended as a demonstration or starting point for developers looking to implement CRUD operations and RESTful design in a Spring Boot application.

### Key Features

- **View All Employees:** Fetches and displays a list of all employees stored in the system.
- **Get Employee By ID:** Retrieves information for a single employee by their unique ID.
- **Filter By Department:** Allows users to find employees belonging to a specific department.
- **Add an Employee:** Enables the creation of new employee records by submitting the relevant details.
- **Delete an Employee:** Provides the ability to remove an employee from the system by their ID.

### How It Works

- Uses Spring Boot to create the REST endpoints.
- Utilizes Spring Data JPA to manage employee data within a database.
- Separates responsibilities through controller, service, repository, and entity layers, following best practices for scalability and maintainability.
- Expects and returns all data in JSON format.

### Intended Use

This project is ideal for:

- Learning and demonstrating RESTful API design with Java Spring Boot.
- Serving as a boilerplate or starting point for more complex employee/resource management applications.
- Showcasing integration between Spring Boot and JPA for real-world data handling.
